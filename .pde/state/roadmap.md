# PACK Roadmap

Prioritized improvements aligned with the North Star: **Zero friction coordination**.

## Now (Current Focus)

| Priority | Item | Friction Reduced |
|----------|------|------------------|
| P0 | Document Node.js v20+ requirement clearly | Onboarding |
| P0 | Sync all changes to pd-claude-cowork | Development |

## Next (Planned)

| Priority | Item | Friction Reduced |
|----------|------|------------------|
| P1 | Single `pack init` command for full setup | Onboarding |
| P1 | Auto-detect available integrations (Gemini, Claude) | Session |
| P2 | Contextual skill suggestions based on current state | Discovery |

## Later (Backlog)

| Priority | Item | Friction Reduced |
|----------|------|------------------|
| P3 | Web UI for viewing handoff log | Visibility |
| P3 | VS Code extension for inline handoffs | Session |
| P4 | Protocol spec for third-party integrations | Ecosystem |

## Rejected (Not Aligned)

| Item | Reason |
|------|--------|
| Cloud sync for logs | Violates portability mandate |
| Required authentication | Adds friction, no clear benefit |
