# THE STRATEGIC LAYER: Paul Davis Experience (PDE)

## 1. The Obsessional Goals (North Star)

* **Professional:** [Describe professional goal]
* **Development:** [Describe development project]
* **Personal:** [Describe personal milestone]

## 2. The Constraints (The Filter)

* **Zero-Inference Rule:** If a task does not directly contribute to the North Star, it is deprioritized.
* **Go Deep, Not Wide:** Do not start new "shiny" projects. Finish [Project A] and [Project B] first.
* **Delegated Discipline:** Motivation is irrelevant. The System runs the routine.

## 3. Tie-Breaking Heuristics

When two tasks seem roughly equal in priority:

1. **Blocker Priority**: If Task A blocks other work and Task B does not, Task A wins.
2. **Momentum Priority**: If Task A takes <15 mins and clears mental clutter, do it before the heavy Task B.
3. **Revenue/Impact**: Choose the task closer to shipping/revenue.

## 4. System Components

| Type | Name | Purpose | Location |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Agent** | Ruthless Prioritizer | Binary task filter & scoring | `.agent/ai/prompts/agent_profiles/ruthless_prioritizer.md` |
| **Agent** | Librarian | Knowledge extraction & linking | `.agent/ai/prompts/agent_profiles/librarian.md` |
| **Workflow** | Daily Startup | Morning ritual & roadmap | `.agent/workflows/daily_startup.md` |
| **Workflow** | Brain Dump | Idea intake & validation | `.agent/workflows/brain_dump.md` |
| **State** | Active Tasks | The single source of truth for todos | `.agent/state/active_tasks.md` |

## 5. Evolution Principle

* **Friction is Signal**: If a workflow creates drag, rewrite it immediately.
* **Updates**: Update this Manifest quarterly.
